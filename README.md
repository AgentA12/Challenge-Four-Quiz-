# Module 5 - Web API'S Challenge

## This weeks challenge was to make a quiz game with html css and javascript 

# Game functionality

## The game functions as a timed quiz, when you start the quiz a timer will begin counting down as you answer a short series of questions. If you answer a question wrong the timer will decrease even further.

## You can also save a score with your initials after you complete the quiz
